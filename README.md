# Page Performance Report

## A fully functional application written in Python showing how you can pull GA4 and GSC data within the API request and show results in a beautiful coloured table with the streamlit 


This project is built in Python to fulfill the need to have a fully automated custom SEO report showing the important metrics of your core and the updated pages. It shows the SEO metrics of your pages after your page content is updated and compares the performance progress within previous and current months. Each part of this project is simply coded to do the following:

* Connect to GA4 API via Python
* Connect to GSC API via Python
* Create authentication files for accessing GA4 and GSC data of your sites (As many sites as you want)
* Request custom filters for the data query such as Country, pages and dates
* Request GA4 metrics such as Conversions, Sessions, Engaged Sessions, Bounce Rate, Engagement Rate, User Engagement Duration, Active Users and Average Engagement Time
* Request GSC metrics such as Clicks, Impressions and Position
* Combine GA4 and GSC data in an Excel sheet
